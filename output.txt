Preface

The book before you, English in Berlin, should be read
against the backdrop of its genesis. It concerns a text
that originated in the spontaneity of direct discussion.
Only afterwards was it transcribed, extended, edited and
finally translated into English. Thus, English in Berlin
also allows us to observe how an Instagram Live discus-
sion may develop into a book.

The idea for the digital discussion series, to which the
episode reproduced here also belongs, came to us both
at the start of 2021. As is to be expected, it was starkly
determined by the pandemic and the accompanying
social distancing measures that rapidly accelerated the
digitalisation of the world in 2020. During this time, in-
teractions with each other shifted more and more online:
one Instagram Live notification came after the other
and email inboxes were properly inundated with Zoom
invitations. When we went online with our Instagram
Live format in Spring 2021, we could already observe a
certain fatigue among many users. People were becom-
ing increasingly aware of the limits and strains of the
pandemic and the digital relations that came with it. And
yet, in spite of the impending exodus from these commu-
nication media, we decided to use one of them to meet
regularly for online discussions of up to 90 minutes. We
committed ourselves to speaking about subjects that
concerned us, as we used to do as friends, before the pan-
demic. We wanted to invite our Followers on Instagram
to take part in the conversation.

Our series of discussions pursued the idea of breaking
away from the dominant logic according to which the
content, language and form of public debates about
socially relevant issues are controlled and regulated by

73

so-called experts. We strived for other forms of speech,
learning and exchange. We conceived our Instagram
Live series as a kind of digital and decentralised talk
show, in which knowledge and discourse would circulate
less vertically than horizontally. A few days before each
episode, we would invite our audience to process publicly
available sources that were relevant to the subject with
us, which we shared in a Google Doc in preparation for
each discussion. We asked them to send us questions and
comments and to take an active part in the conversation
via Live Chat. In this way, the first discussion emerged as
a direct critique and response to the WDR talk show
Die letzte Instanz, which had revealed the racism of Ger-
man television personalities and public broadcasting
editors in January 2021. In our conversation, we argued
for our own debates, which do not align with the whims,
ignorance or arrogance of so-called mainstream culture
and the majority society but rather centre and pursue
their own questions and perspectives.
What does the text gain and what does it lose in the
process of transcription? How does it change when
it’s transmitted and translated from one (plat)form that
is met with distrust to another (plat)form that is institu-
tionally privileged as a ‘source’? How does the afterlife
of a printed and edited text differ from that of unedited,
spoken words? What influence does the form of exchange
have on the limits and possibilities of its contents and
to what extent does it determine its weight and reception?
Due to a technical error, which interestingly only ap-
peared after the transcription of our live discussion, the
original video of our conversation on Instagram froze.
At the moment, it is not possible to play the video or hear
us speaking about this subject in its initial form. The text
is, however, available in this book and it now overwrites
its origin, ina certain way. In this editorial process of
transformation, we decided not to stick to the original.
The present English in Berlin is therefore not wholly con-

74

gruent with the 77-minute-and-13-second conversation
on Instagram. It is left to the reader to recognise where
the spoken text ends and the written one takes over.
English in Berlin has taken on a form that is no longer
determined solely by politics or the arbitrariness of algo-
rithms from the U.S. company Meta, even if the book
market will impose its own politics and arbitrariness on
the text.

The conversation is part of a global critique of elites
that is anything but new, but which is rarely conducted in
this way in the context of a metropolis in the so-called
Global North. Our principal contribution here is the cen-
tring of the perspectives of those who have experienced
biographical, linguistic or legal exclusion in Germany.
On the basis of this experience, we look at conditions in
Berlin and comment on them. These are partly observa-
tions that are rarely articulated in research or in con-
ventional media reporting. That’s why it seems all the
more important to us as observers and participants
of—as well as people affected by—these economic, politi-
cal, social and cultural conditions and urban transforma-
tions, to speak about these issues and thereby bring
them into focus. Through conversation we perceive, seek
to understand and name tendencies, contrasts and con-
tradictions. The extensions of the conversation partly
take their cue from the work of Olufémi O. Taiwo and
Sarah Kunz, who critically examine the global, economic
and colonial traditions behind questions of elite mobili-
ties in their respective books Elite Capture (Haymarket
Books, 2022) and The Expatriate (Manchester University
Press, 2023).

Our series of discussions confirmed to us that it’s
possible to produce a counter-public for critical debates
out of the relative periphery of everyday spaces like
social media. Their broad, multifaceted and contra-
dictory resonances helped us to see that other ways of
speaking and reflecting, directed far from hierarchical

75

and exclusionary modes of knowledge production, are
not only possible but also necessary. They are justified
and they generate relevance, even if they are not taken up
in dominant media, which, however, did happen in the
case of our episode on the subject of Nazi legacies and
Nazi backgrounds, which followed English in Berlin. The
media scandalisation of this episode also led to other
topics in our series being overshadowed. So, we were all
the more pleased when Wirklichkeit Books took up
English in Berlin a year later and wanted to publish it as a
book. With this publication, we hope to give the criticism
articulated in it an expanded life and new public sphere.

English in Berlin— Exclusions in
a Cosmopolitan Society

M: Sinthujan, would you like to give an
introduction?

S: Sure. The topic of our conversation today is
English in Berlin. The idea came to meas Iwas
walking around here in Wedding in February 2021
and I noticed some lettering on the exterior wall ,
of a residential building, which read: ‘My Culture is
not a Costume.’ I took a photo of this and posted :
it as a Story, asking who is speaking here, whom it’s
meant to address and who in fact understands it.
That was the point of departure for our discussion.
We wanted to posit this question, of what it means
to speak English in Berlin. And we're trying to de-
scribe who it is that speaks English in Berlin. The
central question here is, who is included by English
in Berlin, and who is excluded.

M: Exactly. In preparation for the discussion,

we put out a call on our Stories for people to send
anecdotes or questions around this topic. We
could start straight away with one comment from
a follower and an anecdote that comes to mind,
and then consider together how such a situation
arises and what it means. I'll just read it out loud:

‘Really cool that you're taking on this topic. I’ve
always felt weird about the fact that in bars,
for example, it’s taken for granted that people
speak English. But it was never an option to
demand, ‘Speak German!’ because then I feel
like I’m playing into this racist formula, that

in Germany, you better speak German. Curious
to see if you address this ambivalence.

78

This fits with a story that I told you before: Re-
cently I was in a shoe shop, and I asked whether
they had a specific model in my size. To which

the saleswoman answered irately in English:

‘Oh, I don’t speak German.’ As though I had done
something wrong. Then I apologised immedi-
ately, as a reflex, because I-like the person in the
message — didn’t want to appear as someone who
insists on speaking German, as though it were the
only legitimate language for public space. This
moment felt really uncomfortable. But at the same
time, I also thought to myself, ‘Wow, you can work
here without speaking German? My parents
didn’t get any work because they couldn't speak
German! And this rule just doesn’t apply to you
all of a sudden?’

S: Yeah, Berlin is a textbook example for these kinds
of encounters. You always experience these situations
in certain districts, whether in shops, cafés, restau-
rants, galleries or other settings. There, you really
do come across people who speak very little or even
no German whatsoever, but who are still in direct
contact with German-speaking clientele. They take
on a representative role, and yet it doesn’t seem to
be required of them that they should speak German.
That’s quite a new development, especially for peo-
ple like us, who went through the German asylum
system in the 1980s and ‘90s. We grew up with par-
ents who, for decades, were not offered German
courses, and of whom it was nonetheless demanded
that they speak German. Even in jobs where not a
single word of German was ever required in order

to perform the work, not to mention ever taking on
a representative role.

79

M: It’s not just the demands of the job market.
Even for family reunification—when your partner
moves from a non-EU country — one has to demon-
strate a knowledge of German. That means for

a lot of people, as for us and our families, that
speaking German is not just a requirement to be
allowed to work in this country but also to be
allowed to exist here at all! People from the Global
South who don’t have any visa privileges are not
granted residency permits without knowledge

of German. This isn’t just limited to basic spoken
knowledge; they’re supposed to be able to read
and write in German shortly after they arrive, or
even beforehand.

S: I know this from parts of my family in Germany.
For three decades they’ve had no secure residency
status here, and no claim to citizenship, because
their knowledge of German is judged by the state as
being too ‘basic’. Because of this, my relatives ask
me time and again to write to the German authorities
in my ‘good German, to ask for a passport in spite of
their ‘bad German’. And their German isn’t even
‘bad’! They just can’t read or write well in German
because, as refugees, they were never given access to
language schools!

M: Oh wow, that’s heart-breaking. As I’m sure
you know, among these mechanisms of entitle-
ment and disenfranchisement is also the issue of
the recognition of educational qualifications.

For many families who have generated a certain
social and economic capital through their edu-
cation in their countries of origin, the integration
into the German system often comes with a decline

80

in social status. Of course, the loss of privileges
presupposes that one must have possessed them
at one time in another country. But the point

I want to make is about the humiliation and dis-
paragement that people experience because their
qualifications are not recognised in Germany.
Why? Because their educations didn’t take place
in German or English, but rather in a language
that simply isn’t acknowledged here. And I see
these cases in direct contrast to those of people
with a knowledge of English—even when this

is the only language they know—who experience
broader empowerment and more agency in Ger-
many, especially in cities.

S: I don’t know how it was for you, but for me it was
the case that, in primary school in the 1990s, we
were hounded through these remedial classes in order
to learn German. It was German for Refugees and
German for Resettlers (ethnic German immigrants
from Eastern European countries), the equivalent
of today’s Welcome Classes. We didn’t have a choice.
Ice cold, we were split from the German children to
be taught German separately, in another classroom.
With this in mind, I find it astonishing and alarming
that English-speaking people can live ten or more
years in Berlin without being forced by Germans to
speak ‘sufficient’ German.

I think our analysis of the language requirements
—for us as children, who are forced; for our parents,
who are denied forms of access; and for expats, from
whom no one expects a willingness to integrate by
way of language acquisition —has nothing to do
with the motivation or means of conservatives and
the right-wing, who fervently deflect this debate
towards national populism. The difference between

81

us and those Germans with a Nazi background and/
or a colonial background who engage in these dis-
cussions is precisely that we don’t make the claim to
be defending the German. For us it is absolutely not
about ensuring the supremacy of the German lan-
guage in public spaces. German is, and remains for
us, an imperialist language that has been and still

is violent. Instead, we'd like to address the hypocrisy
of the double standards behind it and bring to the
forefront of the debate the classist and racist con-
duct that these developments enable.

M: Yes, for us it’s not about speaking German,
but about why speaking English is accepted as
the legitimate alternative in some spaces and
places. And why an anglophone infrastructure
can exist so self-evidently, without being seen as
a parallel society. Because, when parallel soci-
eties are talked about in Germany, the people be-
ing referred to are not usually those we call expats
in this discussion.

S: We began our initial discussions with the question

of whether English is inclusive or exclusive.

M: Yes. And what do you think?

S: | would say that it can be inclusive, depending on
the context, but then it can also exclude. I think, in

82

Berlin, it is a language that predominantly marginal-
ises. And herein lies the problem of understanding

that we have with so many English-speaking people,
who always feel alienated when we voice this critique.

M: We'd also spoken about the different English
dialects that exist, and which collide in certain
spaces. When we talk about English in Berlin,
which English are we talking about?

S: You've also lived in Neukélln, where you weren't
far from Weserstrafe, which, through gentrification,
has become the ‘party mile’ in the past years. When
you walked along Weserstrafe, what kind of English
did you hear there?

M: Hmm. American English.

S: Not British English?

M: More rarely. I have to add that I had a lot to do
with North Americans in Neukélin, who all lived
among each other in a kind of parallel society.
But I believe, or I know where you want to go with
this: they are native speakers, or people... what
did we call it again? ... Exactly, people who speak

83

International School English. An English that you
have to be able to afford. It’s primarily affluent
families who can afford to send their children to
renowned and very expensive schools with inter-
nationally compatible qualifications that are

valid in the West. It’s rare that you hear an Eng-
lish in Weserstrafe that doesn’t sound native or
academic.

S: Yeah. Even people who come from the so-called
Global South and live here in Berlin don’t usually
speak the ‘average English’ of their countries of ori-
gin. It’s more often a case of International School
English, which is of course better than our English,
learned in the German educational system. That
shouldn't be taken as surprising or strange. Contrary
to what Europeans assume and successfully prom-
ulgate around the world, European educational sys-
tems are not better than non-European ones. What

I actually want to say with this is that you explicitly
notice which class they probably come from in the
‘Global South’, or rather, from which forms of access
they might benefit. These people may come from
the so-called Global South, but indeed, from its rich
areas. They come from urban, bourgeois and aca-
demic households, which actually have much more
in common economically and socially with the so-
called Global North than with the clichéd and par-
ticularly class-ignorant conceptions of these areas
outside of Europe, which exist here. Class-specific
distinctions are almost never made in these observa-
tions. Of course, it’s the mobile classes of the so-
called Global South who gain most from this, who
can subsequently act as though they were the repre-
sentatives of another world. But they’re not.

84

M: Oh yeah, I also know a few who stretch this
into a career model.

S: Recently, when I ordered something to eat from
Lieferando, a delivery man came who could only
speak ‘broken’ English and absolutely no German.
After a short conversation, I found out that he came
from India. By now there are many people from the
Indian subcontinent in Berlin, in numbers there never
were here before. Many of them work under very
precarious job conditions, for example as drivers for
delivery service start-ups. That is a relatively new
development, which alters the image of Berlin as a
city. Today you see, for example, men with Sikh tur-
bans on electric bicycles riding through the city,
as they simultaneously speak Punjabi or Hindi into
their phones and navigate through the city. That
was, until recently, an image and a soundscape that
you were more likely to know from the colonial met-
ropolis of London.

This group of racialised workers, who have sud-
denly become so visible on an everyday basis on
the streets of Berlin, but who nonetheless remain
so invisible in discussions and in the perception of
labour migration, experiences a totally different
reality here from those we encounter so prominently
in our artistic and creative milieus. The latter are,
however, those who loudly proclaim that they repre-
sent the Global South. As they do so, debates that
are relevant for all racialised people are not conduct-
ed in the English of the delivery driver from India
but in International School English, the language of
the capital-rich elites.

85

M: Yes. It seems to me that, in these discussions,
racialised expats stand in direct competition
with us as racialised people who grew up here. This
is a competition that arises from the artificial
scarcity of representation of non-white people in
Germany. In contrast to those who grew up here,
expats often have totally other backgrounds and
are therefore immediately more attractive for the
culture industry. They tend to come from social
contexts in which the society’s approach to diver-
sity is much more advanced than in Germany.
They experience other forms of mobility, visibility,
and potentials for speaking, thinking and feeling.
In London, for example, there is a totally differ-
ent treatment of people who have experienced
racism, as the discourse there has developed over
several generations and colonial histories are
much more immediately present —both on the
streets and in discourses. Our self-conception is
often different. Some of those people who move
from London to Berlin as racialised creative
workers are children from the second or third
generation of immigrants or refugees, whose par-
ents have experienced other forms of mobility
in Great Britain than our parents have in Germany.
Their parents often speak more English than

M: Exactly. People with these biographies move
through the culture industry with another self-
conception entirely. They come with CVs in the
bag that are not at all comparable with our educa-

tional qualifications and our attempts to find
internships and jobs in Germany.

S: In Great Britain there are, from my observations,
also more opportunities for racialised people and
people from working class backgrounds to progress
than there are here. The educational system there is
more open for people from non-academic families.
In Germany, conversely, the educational inequalities
are manifestly awful. The selection process here al-
ready begins with children and continues into adult-
hood. After my Abitur (equivalent of A Levels in

the UK) I also went straight to London to study, be-
cause of the gloomy prospects that I saw in Germany.
In the countryside, where I was forced to grow up,

it was even worse than in the city. You also did a year
abroad in London later, right?

M: Yes, I did a year of studies there. That was
really eye-opening for me, to see how homog-

our parents do German. There’s a system and a
history to this. Many of the racialised people
there come from former British colonies, where
they were of course differently exposed to the
English language.

enous and uncritical my educational trajectory
was and how many opportunities are taken from
people like us through the many social exclusions
that are still wholly accepted here. In London,
racialised people move much more self-evidently
through different milicus and their living condi-
el tions are significantly more varied. Generally,

86 87

S: They often even feel British!

M: Yeah, because they’ve contributed to writing
British history and their struggles and their cul-
tures have also altered the country, and that can't
be put into question. During my time in school J
in Germany we were still discussing whether this
was a country of immigration. Here there are so
few non-white people active in politics that we
relativise right-wing and neoliberal content in our
desire for diversity, just because the up-and-com-
ing politicians have names from somewhere else.
We were ourselves in the role of expats in other
countries then too. I can imagine that the local

population in London or Jordan perceived me that
way when I lived there as an international student.

I think that’s a role that you can fall into more
quickly than you might think if you don’t actively
consider the structures in which you operate. At
my university in London, for example, many
British students studied only part-time and had R
jobs on the side, in order to be able to afford their
studies at all. The university was not interested
in expanding scholarships to cover the local stu-
dents, because they had enough demand through
the international students from rich households
and through foreign scholarships. I too was in
London on a German scholarship. That was an
interesting experience, to stand on the other side
of the ‘import economy’.

S: I don’t know if the term expat really makes sense
in my case. I didn’t spend a year abroad there, nor did

88

T arrive with a scholarship or any other financial sup-
port but rather I had to struggle for ten years at
my own expense, aside from BAf@G (German federal
student grant). Beyond that, I had to take a student
loan in order to pay my tuition fees. Just like the
students from the working class there. So, I really
lived in London. It was the only place ‘abroad’ that
I could have afforded during those ten years of my
life. Just physically being in that very expensive city
was such a huge financial challenge for me and my
family, that I couldn't afford a holiday or a semester
abroad during that time. While it felt like my school-
friends from Germany at that time were travelling
during every break and doing Erasmus programmes
here and there, I had to make sure that I wasn’t home-
less in London. The Germans I met there at the uni-
versities were also often from academic families and
mostly came with scholarships. They were usually
only there temporarily. For them it was a year abroad
among many others that jazzed up their CVs, made
them appear ‘more international’, and which were
maybe followed by periods in Berkeley or Monash.
It wasn’t like that for me. London was my second
exile. My British exile from the German exile, from
my family’s exile from ‘Sri Lankan’-occupied Eelam.
Unlike expats here, there I was neither especially
cool or desirable, nor in any way more mobile than
others with similar starting conditions to mine. My
social capital functioned differently there. Ihad many
more economic and emotional insecurities because—
unlike the other Eelam Tamils, for example, who
grew up in London-—I had no family there who earned
in Sterling, or who could help me out in emergencies.
As anon-expat in Berlin, being friends with expats
has something to do with status. It translates into
an expression of social and cultural capital. For
many, it changes their external and internal percep-

89

tion, and you acquire international relationships—
not just places to stay overnight but also networks
that could potentially take you further in your career.
A circle of expat friends makes you cosmopolitan,
which is to say, globally ‘more relevant’. My presence
in London didn’t have the same effect. There I was
just one of hundreds of thousands of people from
abroad, who came and went. The people there were
more confused and fascinated by my biography

and my accent. In London I was even described as

a double FoB by other non-white people. That was
not positive.

M: FoB, as in Fresh off the Boat.

S: Exactly. London is in fact set up differently than
Berlin, politically and economically speaking. For
decades, actually for centuries, it has attracted
tens of thousands of people every year, as a hyper-
capitalist, colonial metropole. 5
Asylum seekers who arrived in divided Berlin, 7
like my family back then, often had little interest in
staying here, as the city didn’t possess a strong
economy and it was cut off from the rest of Western
Europe. Berlin is indeed still one of the poorest
and, at the same time, cheapest Western European
capital cities; and there is a widespread view among
many ethnic minorities in the old federal states
that Berlin is a dirty and regressive city that offers
no future to people like us. Accordingly, my parents
were anything but glad about me moving from

90

London to Berlin. For them it was a socioeconomic
regression of which they couldn’t make sense, and
which didn’t advance me but rather set me back in
terms of opportunities and development. They still
tell me that I should go back to London (laughs).

M: Yeah. London has this reputation, that there
are more chances for migrants to further them-
selves there. The dynamic is more neoliberal.
Berlin, however, is known for being a city you
move to in order to slow down. Expats come to
Berlin to avoid the economic pressure of other
cities; you can survive here ona significantly
lower income than in Paris, New York or London.
Those who can afford it come here to switch off
and enjoy their lives, to drink a beer at 11am by
the Spree or a flat white in one of the many cafés.
But with what you're telling me, it doesn’t sound
like it was your chosen home.

S: Our families had very little choice when they came
to Germany. They were fleeing genocides and wars
when they came to this country. And even once they'd
entered the asylum system, they had very little
freedom to make decisions. Hence, we were driven
out of one camp into the next, literally out of the
cities—including Berlin—and with that, out of white
people's sight.

M: Here, you only have to listen to the stories
of racialised people who were socialised in
Germany, who were rejected from art, acting
and film schools, for example, and with what
kinds of racist arguments they were turned

With all the exclusions and financial insecurities
here, many who have these dreams become dis-
paraged and never take up careers in these fields,
because the reality in Germany is just so depress-
ing for people like us. And it’s all the more de-
pressing when you see that, in discussions around
subjects like racism, the views of people who have
experienced the prevailing conditions here from
a young age are often replaced by anglophone,
expat perspectives. The debates, discourses and
the people are imported, and then they stand

in a distorted contrast to the local context. State-
ments are made, like, ‘It’s still better in Germany
than in the US,’ or ‘Berlin doesn’t feel like Ger-
many at all. You don’t experience much racism at

all’ Those who are speaking are not at all familiar

enough with the German context to make such
claims. They’re socialised totally differently, and
they have a totally different relationship to Ger-

man mainstream society, the German government

and history.

S: Yeah, analyses come about that are articulated to
us very self-assuredly, almost arrogantly. Many
racialised, English-speaking expats would indeed like
to understand local racism, insofar as they want to
contextualise and, to a certain extent, historicise

it. But in their attempts at explanation you can often
see, in my opinion, that they lack an understanding
of the idiosyncrasies of the German context. This
context is not, as many Germans would very proudly
like to proclaim, ‘more special’ than other histories.
White supremacy, you know. But, as in any other
context, a linguistic approach is necessary. It allows
us to understand the cultural nuances of a history,

a place and a society.

94

M: Expats rarely do this.

S: Exactly, most English-speaking expats, whether
white or racialised, don't speak German because
they can have a good life here without even a super-
ficial knowledge of German. Nevertheless, as resi-
dents they have opinions on this city and this country,
understandably. But they often come to conclusions
that derive from a Western, globalised, American
or British perspective, but which do not necessarily
cohere with the prevailing conditions here. As you
say, debates are imported and exposed to the local
context, although you don’t do the realities here any
justice that way.

The body measurements that the Nazis and their
many race researchers conducted created local
realities with which we are still struggling. But they
also created other gradations of distinction than
in France, for instance. Here, as a German, you don’t
actually have to have another skin colour to qualify
as being ‘of Color’: many forms of racial exclusion
here are not based on perceptible differences in skin
tones, but rather on other forms of racial markers.
In an anglophone setting, due to the respective turns
of colonial histories, more diverse societies exist that
are skin-colour-specific. And yet we strenuously
try to find meaning, as we orientate ourselves to pat-
terns of analysis, speech and action that come from
there. That’s why we're also trying, in this discus-
sion, to find a mode of speech that can take place in-
dependently of their analyses, which were propa-
gated elsewhere and thus exist in different relations
histories and languages. :

95

Lalso believe that English often works as a shortcut
that we feel tempted to take. Of course, because

a large part of the knowledge that we garner online
and offline, in universities and libraries, is only
available in English. And often, we don't even per-
form the translation work that is actually necessary.
At the same time, German institutions also have

no interest in performing this work of translation.
They're much more interested in putting capital

in racialised people who are socialised outside

of Germany than in those whose experience is fash-
ioned by the racism of German society and who
verbalise this experience in German. It’s much more
convenient —and controllable! —for them and the
many neoliberal diversity programmes that they
prescribe for the purpose of the capitalist subsump-
tion of struggles for social and economic justice.

M:... and it’s more efficient, because in the same
move they’re not only talking about racism but
they're able to show how open-minded and well
networked they are. Within this logic, it’s always
more profitable for institutions to invite people
who can serve several functions. Accordingly, a

ers, art institutions that want to be more diverse
direct their focus towards the way they're per-
ceived from the outside: which names, topics and
identities can we incorporate as quickly and effi-
ciently as possible into our programmes in order
to stay relevant? Whose portfolio, CV or even
appearance enriches our image as a globally net-
worked and relevant institution: the racialised
person from Essen or the one from New York,
Mexico City or New Delhi? Even when J, person-
ally, wouldn't see the person from Essen as com-
peting with the one from New York, they do come
into competition in this context of restricted
openness within German cultural programmes.
As there’s only so many places, slots and attention
for ‘the others’. That sounds calculating and taste-
less, but decisions are often made, consciously

or unconsciously, according to these criteria.
That’s the principle behind tokenism. Only super-
ficial or symbolic efforts are made in the interest
of inclusion, diversity or anti-racism, for exam-
ple. Through the engagement of a small number
from underrepresented groups or even just in-
dividuals, the institution is supposed to appear
altogether more egalitarian.

racialised person who, for example, was born and
raised in Essen, can say less about their supposed
origins, otherness or whatever particular iden-
tity is superficially associated with them. That’s
why it is of course more interesting for a curator
to invite someone from somewhere seemingly
far away, abroad or whatever, who not only makes
an exhibition programme appear more diverse
but also more international at the same time.
Instead of bringing more people with different
biographies into their teams and thereby impelling
substantial change in the configuration of employ-

S: It affects them even less! This occurred to mea
long time ago at an event for refugees and white aid
and solidarity workers: a comedian with refugee
experience talked in English about how he came to
Germany. And as he did so, he kept using the term
‘white people’ and the whole room, which was pre-
dominantly white, laughed at his stories. I asked
myself the whole time whether these people would
still be laughing if the comedian were talking about
‘weifve Menschen’. Would the audience be just as

96 97

amused if he said ‘Germans’ instead? If he talked
about people with a Nazi or colonial background?

I don’t think so. People with Nazi and colonial
backgrounds get on much better with the term
‘white people’ because they can move away from a
clear designation with it, and conversely, they can
take away from us the possibility of making a

clear designation. Because we are that which is un-
comfortable for both sides. We are unpleasant

for a mainstream society that doesn’t want to hear
us speak but would at the same time pretend to

be inclusive and diverse. In order to maintain this
self-image, people from other contexts are imported
into this country who don’t address Germany’s
most intimate escapades, because these are foreign
to them and perhaps not so important. On the
other hand, we compete, as you say, in a battle for
resources that is regulated from above, against art-
ists, academics and freelancers who get shuttled
with a priority ticket onto the country’s big, institu-
tional platforms, which we would sometimes need
20 years or more to get to. Platforms that only exist
because of the racialised and economically exploited
people who toiled and fought for them for so long.
People who still clean these platforms, only to be
eventually replaced by racialised elites from abroad
who then presume to speak on their behalf. The
great ‘subaltern’!

people’, while it’s highly likely that they would by
the term ‘weijf%e Menschen’, makes an impression
here. And along with this comes the question
regarding the extent to which the self-designation
‘of Color’ is at all meaningful as a concept for the
racism and the demographics in Germany. I too
was politicised by English texts and the anglo-
phone Internet, in particular the American reck-
oning with racism by Black and Indigenous peo-
ples. It is an incredible act of translation that
must be performed in order to transfer all of this
onto a local context, which may be intimately con-
nected with the colonialization of the Americas,
but which is, at the same time, different. So again,
American imperialism concerns me as an Afghani
in a very different way to others who live in Ger-
many. Add to this the fact that many-and I include
myself here, I still have a lot to catch up on-still
know very little about the history of resistance by
non-white Germans. I’m now using the term ‘non-
white Germans’ so that we can draw a clear line
between white Germans in Nazi Germany and the
rest... although the wording raises the question of
how far we include people in the resistance, such
as communists... Hmm...

S: Just say people without a Nazi

M: That also takes us to the subject of how help- background (laughs).1
ful English is as a language of protest. How far

does it make sense to convey and analyse our own

experiences of discrimination and marginalisa-

tion in English, particularly in the context of

German history? Your example with the audience

that doesn’t feel addressed by the term ‘white

98 99

M: The line between Germans with and
without a Nazi background (laughs).

S: I’ve already read in the chat that everyone
finds the term pretty great.

M: Since our initial conversation on Instagram
Live in February 2021 some things have devel-
oped structurally and discursively, and in some
parts of the texts you can recognise that we have
allowed ourselves extensions, additions and
reworkings. One such development came with a
term that we use here today and which, in the
next conversation the following week -on Nazi
legacies —struck up its entire own debate. Here we
use “Nazi background’ to find a common language
for a power relation that we perceive, and which
continues to exert its effects in today’s society.
The denomination of material continuities in Ger-
man art and cultural spaces then led many people,
and especially the German press, to react espe-
cially defensively and indeed aggressively. Look-
ing back on this moment in the conversation is
kind of amusing, isn’t it?

S: Yeah, for sure! I had actually already put the term
in a Story in November 2020, but this debate only
took off in February 2021. In hindsight, it confirms
precisely what I mean here when I say that people
can evade critique when they don’t feel addressed by

100

the designation; when the designations don’t apply
to them, when they get stuck in translation loops and
with that, remain abstract. They are, in certain re-
spects, forms of non-mentions, which do the least
for those who are adversely affected. On the con-
trary: they drive them into a psychological and emo-
tional dilemma. In this kind of societal and political
context, if we call something by its name, everyone
flips out. We saw this with the press’ subsequent de-
bate around us, which wasn’t a debate in the proper
sense, but a defensive reaction from people who
would rather approach this history abstractly and
theoretically than personally. Because then the
aggression isn’t directed at the problems that are
actually being dealt with, but at the people who
have dared to disturb this questionable cooperation
that has been the logic of state and society in Ger-
many since the capitulation of 1945. With this, I find
that it becomes clear just how important the con-
ceptual work is that is being done by people who
—with or without imports—are prepared to develop
something here that corresponds to the history and
context and responds to them.

M: I mean, we also lack knowledge on some histo-
ries and local voices. Almost everyone knows
American activists, academics and cultural pro-
ducers, maybe also British ones, but do we know
of German equivalents? Or others from closer
proximity, for example, from France or the Nether-
lands? The cultural imperialism of the USA and
the anglophone world leads, generally speaking,
to more interest in histories of others than in your
own. I’m caught up in this too, as I sometimes
passively follow debates around the US Supreme
Court more intensively than comparable debates

101

in the Bundestag. It’s the media that I consume
on aregular basis, which is produced in the USA
and accessible worldwide. It’s also processed :
into memes, tweets, TikTok videos and it domi-
nates our social media feeds.

When you think about how familiar the latest
political developments in the USA appear to us,
and how foreign parliamentary debates from
Poland or Turkey appear in comparison, although
they affect more people in Germany more direct-
ly, then the cultural dominance of anglophone
discourses becomes more apparent. The media
sometimes comes to us in translation or dubbed,
but—thanks to the normalisation of the English
linguistic hegemony—now also increasingly in

the original language. We often grow up more sen-

sitive to stories from there than to the stories
that play out beyond the English-speaking world.
The stories that take place in front of our own
front doors are not so cool, don’t go so viral, and

they remain only of local interest. Maybe we know
abit more about them in our cultural-political and

social-critical circles because a lot is being done
there to amplify these voices within Germany, to
make their poetry and texts more visible in the
German culture of remembrance, as in the case

of Semra Ertan. But these are quite rare and novel

developments, and above all they take place be-
yond the institutionalisation and canonisation of
German memory. Even today, you learn almost

nothing about these people in schools or from oth-

er sources in mainstream society.

§: Lwould like to come back to what you said at the
beginning, about our language of protest. Since, i
in the specific context of Berlin, you have to consider

102

who actually lives here. What are the population's
majorities and minorities? In 2019, the Federal
Office for Statistics published new figures on this.
According to these statistics, more than a third

of population living in Berlin is constituted by peo-
ple without a Nazi background. That also includes
people who have one parent without a Nazi back-
ground, which is why the image is a little distorted.
The largest groups that are not ethnically German
are, they say, Polish-, Turkish-, Arabic- and Russian-
speaking people. These figures have to be considered
in the discussion around expats, or the dominant,
Western-privileged, English-speaking demographic
groups. Because the majority of people who are cat-
egorised as so-called foreigners don’t speak English
as their mother tongue or as a second language.

It’s other languages: Polish, Russian, Turkish, Kurd-
ish or Arabic. I think this fact is often left unsaid,
nor is it considered in public administration. When,
for example, information is communicated in public
space, it’s usually in German and English, instead
of being translated into Polish, Kurdish or Turkish.
Certain demographic groups just get sidestepped

in this development. Because this phenomenon, that
we keep hearing more and more English on the streets
of Berlin, is actually still a relatively recent one.

The experience of this was especially stark in the
first phase of the Corona pandemic. I experienced
this very consciously in Wedding, a district of Berlin
that, along with Gesundbrunnen, has the highest
quota of ‘people from abroad’; 54% of the popu-
lation here is not ethnically German or has at least
one parent who is not ethnically German. That’s
more than in Neukélln, and the majority of them are,
of course, not English-speaking. Nevertheless, since
the outbreak of the pandemic, in the so-called sys-
tem-relevant shops—such as chemists, where dis-

103

infectants and masks are sold-the hygiene displays
were written in English, after they were initially
pinned up in German. That means that a large part
of the local population was not involved linguisti-
cally at all. I find that very tragic. It really took a
few days until this was adjusted. The same happened
in information media like Spiegel Online, until they
began reporting in Turkish.

What is also interesting in this context is that the
Berliner Zeitung has had for a few years now not,
for example, a Turkish- but rather an English-lan-
guage segment. It’s really prominent and it serves as
one of a handful of significant, local news sources
for expats, because there is very consciously no pay-
wall. So, you see what kind of patrons are meant
to be acquired here, who the readers should be, who
clicks on their adverts. The Local is another site
that serves as an information portal for city-related
news among English-speaking expats.

The official Berlin city website also follows a simi-
lar selection and exclusion policy to the Berliner
Zeitung. It offers no information in Kurdish, Arabic,
Turkish, Polish or Russian but does in English,
French and Italian. That shows that a majority pop-
ulation which doesn’t communicate in English or
any other imperial language at home is not only not
being addressed but actively ignored.

Lalso observe this phenomenon at protests some-
times: there, for one, you have obviously the pro-
test of people without Nazi backgrounds, which is
directed towards the majority population and must
therefore take place in German. But then, at the
same time, we can see how English asserts itself
more and more, how English slogans from protest
movements in the so-called United States, Great
Britain and other anglophone countries are taken
up, one to one, although they’re supposed to address

104

and engage the German context. Who understands
this, though? Who are these posters and placards
for? Are they for the passers-by and residents in the
immediate vicinity or for consumers of social media
in English-speaking countries abroad?

M: Straight away, we can take as examples the
protests around Black Lives Matter and George
Floyd, but also the protests around anti-Asian
racism, abortion rights, prison abolitionism or
gun violence, We often borrow our knowledge
and our language about these political problems
from debates and activism in the USA. We can
better explain and problematise the prison system
or police violence with examples from American
institutions than if we do so in relation to local,
German institutions. With the example of Black
Lives Matter and alongside this, how the protests
in Berlin and the reporting in German were aligned
with them, you could see how, not only the lan-
guage, but also the subjects and cases being
referred to were taken from the USA. As if there
were no racist police violence here, as though
there were no fatalities of German police violence.
Of course, a global, anti-racist solidarity move-
ment is important, and I do also take to the streets
for George Floyd. But it’s perplexing to see the
masses of people in Germany who felt addressed
by this and took to the streets, but who stayed
away when it concerned the murder of Oury Jalloh
or Hanau-—cases in Germany that demonstrated
symbolic watersheds for anti-racist work.

105

S: Or NSU!

M: Or NSU!

S: But let’s go back to a really foundational question:
where do people speak English in Berlin? In my ex-
perience, we encounter the English language mostly
in districts like Mitte, Neukélln or Kreuzberg. So,

in the especially gentrification-happy or heavily gen-
trified parts of the city. There, you have places

like cafés, cultural sites, museums, creative spaces,
galleries, hip restaurants...

M: Everything that’s somehow hip.

S: Start-ups!

M: Exactly, start-ups. But also, in clothing or
bookstores, according to where you go shopping.

106

S: Among the bookstores I can think of: She Said
(Kreuzk6lln), Hopscotsch (Schéneberg), Motto
(Kreuzberg), a.p. (Wedding) and do you read me?!
(Mitte) —a bookshop that I really love! But when you
go on the do you read me?! website, almost every-
thing is given in English. And that’s a problem. As a
business in Germany, you first have to be able to
afford to do that: in a majority non-English-speaking
context, to take on the financial risk of ignoring the
language of the market majority and its customers!

Additionally, we should talk about the fact that
these bookstores are also active protagonists of
a classist politics, which is never named as such,
because you actually only want to speak positively
about these businesses. But also, of course, because
they attract a critical customer base with the sale
of books with leftist contents, and with that, they
generate an image that doesn’t necessarily draw this
critique. Although they, too, are often expressions
of urban gentrification processes, they also sell
books about precisely those urban development
processes. Beyond that, they host events in which
those political and sociological developments are
regarded critically —as though they were neutral and
not involved. It’s all a bit schizophrenic. The gentri-
fiers are always the others, not oneself. But we know
this from questions about prosperity, racism, sexism
and Nazism.

And I think we're also unwilling to concern our-
selves with this, because it’s uncomfortable, since
it’s our own milieu. The people who shop and work
there are not so far from us. I also shop in these
stores, and I like spending time there. But then it’s
all the more important to address the exclusive lan-
guage policies of these bookstores that see them-
selves as progressive. If the entire Instagram page
is run in English—including every possible notice

107

about Corona-there’s a problem here. It’s alienating,
excluding and classist, and it even has racist conno-
tations in the end. Because the people who are con-
sciously shut out here, because of their class back-
ground, often have certain ethnic origins too, which
we all know... access to education and with that,

of course, knowledge of English, are directly de-
pendent on socioeconomic factors in this country.

M: You've basically just given an answer to the
question put forward at the outset, of whether
English is inclusive. In the case of these book-
stores, you would say no, that it serves to exclude?

S: Yes. But we shouldn't forget that English is ame-
nable to capital, which means that, behinds its
presence and spread, there are capitalist interests.
The way in which Berlin markets itself on a global
market is based on its desire to establish itself as

a world city, as it apparently once was, 100 years ago
in a largely colonised world. That’s why Berlin has
an interest in start-ups, artists and freelancers, who
come to the city and give it an image that leads to
Berlin being able to acquire more capital, and thus
the investment budget of the city multiplies. For
this reason, there is not only acceptance but promo-
tion of conditions that continue to normalise speak-
ing in English, even in parts of the city like Wedding.
Berlin is supposed to be perceived as a metropolis
where you can also manage everyday life in English,
precisely to attract this solvent clientele: people
who would describe themselves as digital nomads,
who set themselves up here for two or three years
before they move on to Tel Aviv, New York, London
or Barcelona.

108

I think you also have to hold the state responsible for
this. Because this expat-isation, which is promoted
by Berlin and Germany, is an important aspect of
the gentrification of poor districts. At the same
time, expats remove themselves from these discus-
sions. They often don’t need to think along local
lines at all, because their whole existence in the city
is only temporary.

This policy of outsider perception is also manifest-
ed in the way the Goethe Institut or even the Foreign
Office use the ‘hip’, ‘cool’, almost “un-German”
image of Berlin as a brand to promote the city and
Germany in general. The soft power behind this
shouldn't be trivialised. ‘Poor but sexy’ might sound
funny, but it’s actually quite a duplicitous PR strat-
egy, which has functioned very successfully for
Berlin since 2003.

The whole club culture, and especially the Berghain
image of the city, which in 2015 even managed to
find its way to the Ellen DeGeneres talk show in the
so-called USA, is part of a clever marketing concept,
which projects Berlin outward and invests the city
with an international profile. It creates new associa-
tions, where once there was only the Wall, the Nazi
regime and stiff Germans. And if this alternative
image of the scene leads to an inevitable increase in
drug consumption and alcoholism among young
people, which even led to the drug-related death of
a young tourist from the so-called USA in 2018:
all of this is part of the formula. This policy is
attractive for the city, because in the end, it brings
a certain class of people into the city who are also
prepared to consume in a certain way, and with
that they become economically useful to the city
and the country.

Berghain has become a poster child for Berlin and
Germany. In Berlin, the club scene is also linked

109

to capitalist interests, indeed, to state interests, in
spite of its alternative image. The Berlin Senate
declared clubs as cultural sites in 2020. One year
later, the Federal Government did something similar.
Clubs are thus on a par with established, bourgeois
cultural spaces, and are considered from a state
perspective to be especially worthy of protection.
Since the 2000s, there has been a kind of club lobby,
which was especially active during the high point

of the pandemic, and which represented the interests
of club owners and visitors pretty successfully. In
the end, it was rarely clubs that disappeared from
the map because of the pandemic. Although the

club lobby often protested the loudest, it was most-
ly other, smalier individual businesses without any
lobbies at all that had to fight for their interests.
They weren't deemed particularly necessary to pro-
tect or ‘productive’ for the desired urban develop-
ment. Many neighbourhood shops, off licenses, tea-
houses, bakeries, hairdressers, older cafés and other
stores had to close their doors during the lockdown.
The death of these establishments affected many
racialised people in particular, who had begun in the
previous years to operate as sole traders in order to
secure their right of abode in Germany and to shield
themselves from discrimination in the workplace.

M: Let’s look into a comment that’s just been
posted in the chat: here it’s been noted that Eng-
lish is a colonial language, which sits in a hierar-
chical position in relation to other languages.
Accordingly, people who also speak this language
are valorised differently. There’s a higher value

to mastering English than, let’s say, five other lan-
guages, of which not a single one is a colonial
language. We've already spoken about the culture

110

sector, which lives from a cosmopolitan image.
Here, for instance, cosmopolitan material is hap-
pily confused with anti-racist themes.

I think, at this point, it’s appropriate to think
about what cosmopolitan even means. Cosmopoli-
tanism is, in other ways, an ideology of so-called
world citizenship. A view on the world that people
take up who can move geographically without
restrictions, and who sce the entire world as their
home or accessible to them. Cosmopolites have
often lived in different places around the world
and belong to a mobile class, which actually moves
beyond the regime of borders and linguistic bar-
riers but is able to settle. Cosmopolites have to be
able to speak English and they hold almost exclu-
sively passports from Western, industrial nations,
although as individuals, they see themselves as
the antithesis of the nationalism or provincialism
of their countries of origin. You could say, how-
ever, that the cosmopolitan bubbles are also
mobile provinces in themselves, in which most
probably share the same friends on Facebook,
bumping into and meeting up with each other in
similar cafés and restaurants. These self-appoint-
ed, uprooted people with their decontextualised
interests are better situated economically, and
as such also represent an attractive target group,
as in the example of Berlin’s marketing strategy.
When we talk here about Berlin as a supposedly
cosmopolitan city, or about expats, then this
is the context that we're sketching out as our back-
drop. I think it’s important once again to define
this, because the term ‘cosmopolitan’ has been dif-
ferently connotated and utilised at different times.
While it was positively connotated in the Enlight-
enment and at the height of European colonial-
ism, during Nazism as well as under Stalin it was

111

used as a reproach, in order to discredit Jews and
to accuse them of conspiring against the nation.
In the context of ethnonationalist state ideology,
uprooting becomes an accusation of treason.

I find this especially interesting, if you look at
contemporary debates around German dual citi-
zenship, for example. Similar accusations are
made here. The credibility and ‘loyalty’ of these
people are put into question. How trustworthy
are these foreigners if they carry other identities
with them or have sympathies and attachments
aside from Germany? This test of convictions
begins early, when for example, migrant children
in kindergarten or in school speak other languag-
es among one another and the teachers are the
first to react allergically, as though they were con-
spiring against the group and the authority of the
teacher. The accusation of conspiracy against
mainstream society, against the status quo, is also
inherent to the German fear of parallel societies.

So, if we speak about something being cosmo-
politan, as children of refugees, we don’t refer
to this uprooting as a reproach-—fuck loyalty to
state constructs! I think we're questioning the
performance of open-mindedness and uprooting
by privileged people. It is fitting that a large num-
ber of the events in exhibition spaces such as
SAVVY Contemporary in Wedding or other art
spaces are exclusively in English...

S:...and only publicised in English.

112

M: Here you have to ask what funds are flowing
into these places and what roles are assigned to
them. It’s already a problem that there are so few
progressive and anti-racist places, or else places
that work explicitly with decolonial approaches.
And when they do exist, they reproduce the lin-
guistic hegemony that excludes the local popula-
tion, and then bring in themes from outside this
space, failing to integrate their own neighbours.
This is also a symptom of the fact that local
racism, local structural problems are simply less
attractive than those that you import into these
spaces from the outside. Imported themes remain
abstract, they remain subject matter, while im-
mediate political conflicts in the neighbourhood
affect one’s own day-to-day work, the funding
bodies and the visitors. The phenomenon of mo-
bile classes, enticed by and settled into a certain
infrastructure, like UFOs which then lift off
and disappear, is indeed even more pronounced
in the development sector.
In a certain way, Berlin was initially considered as
a development hotspot, with its low rents and
its homogenous cultural landscape, which is why
so many settled here. However, I think this econo-
my finds its concrete culmination in places like
Kabul. Here, you really had the peak of the expat
economy, mobile classes of people who are totally
isolated from the local population: enticed by
subventions, they come and then just as quickly
disappear again as soon as it’s not worth it any-
more. In the case of Afghanistan, it was develop-
ment aid, in the case of Berlin it’s tax money.

S: Td like to underline your point about funds at
this point. Since it’s public money that many of

113

these institutions receive, as in tax money, which
they invest in projects and programmes that largely
exclude the local population.

SAVVY is a good example, as is the Berlin Biennale
and other institutions that engage with contempo-
rary art in the city. They all demonstrate similar pat-
terns. You have to be aware of them: It’s tax money
that’s used to create spaces and support milieus
that don’t necessarily involve the people who live in
the immediate vicinity of these institutions. Quite
the opposite. These institutions often expand within
poor neighbourhoods because rents there are lower,
due to this poverty. They are coveted by landlords
because they accelerate social change and thereby
drive up the value of rental properties. They help
profits and are probably still represented in some
statistics as being beneficial for the neighbourhood.
Yet they do little for the people themselves. They
profit from the poverty of the local population and
at the same time contribute to the displacement of
that very same population.

Something comparable already happened with
Columbia University in Harlem, or the university
campus in the new Queen Elizabeth Park in East
London. Similar to SAVVY, both began advertising
with references to these places that were regis-
tered in the middle-class mindset as being decrepit.
‘Right in Harlem’, ‘In the middle of Wedding!’ So
cool! It’s so perverse.

In 2020, I walked past SAVVY, for example. There
I saw a whole range of posters stuck on the large
windowfronts of the former casino that were only
in English. The posters revolved around themes
of solidarity and community and the like. When
I posted this on my Instagram Story, addressing it,
limmediately received comments from the SAVVY
team, who were shocked by my focus on their ex-

114

clusionary and elitist linguistic conduct in the neigh-
bourhood. I even got an email from the director of
SAVVY himself, in which he wrote a long complaint
about my critique. Almost as if it were the first time
that they'd been confronted with this. Apparently,
they'd never given this any thought — or had never
had to. Their naive assumption up to that point had
been that they were supporting the neighbourhood.
After my Story, SAVVY seemed to be worried that
their self-image and role as a ‘socially critical exhi-
bition space’ in Wedding could be thrown into ques-
tion. And that this critique could be seen by the
‘important’ people. They didn’t want to hear this
critique, and above all, they didn’t want to see it in
public. Because that would be bad PR.

Here I think: there’s nothing new about this. These
patterns of behaviour apply to big museums, uni-
versities, galleries, as well as small ones—precisely
those that sell themselves as being ‘decolonial’ and
claim to be ‘radical’. The funds that support this
kind of art communication are mostly public. This
country invests a lot in culture and art. I find that we
have to pay much more attention to our rights and
be mindful of how public funds are used, for whom
they’re used and who is supported by them. As people
who form part of this society, we have a right to
co-determination and to demand that we and our
families, who live and work here, are considered in
the conception of these spaces. But it seems to be
totally fine in Berlin, in the middle of Wedding,
to host an event that’s completely in English, with-
out translations, without texts in German, without
German information booklets, or the like. This is
what so frustrates me about the climate in this city.

I was involved in forming a collective a few
years ago that was concerned with food and politics.
Ileft precisely for this reason. It was just too much

115

for me, to sit in Kreuzberg, do a few things, the con-
tents of which were indeed interesting, but which
simultaneously failed to think with the neighbour-
hood. Theoretically, people from the neighbourhood
could have come along, it was just that the space
was not conceived to meet their language needs.

I believe we have to be more honest with each other
at this point, and say, ‘It just doesn’t work this

way. English isn’t actually the language spoken by
most people here.’

And the German language also has a system and

’ apolitical history: up until 1919, as one of many
European colonial languages, German was still for-
cibly inserted into the world and criminally imposed
on many colonised peoples. After 1945, it was the
‘foreigners’ who came as workers or refugees to this
former colonial metropolis who were once again
forcefully told, ‘Here you speak German!’ Hence,
German is connected with a lot of violence for peo-
ple like us. Many of us were attacked when speaking
a language in public that was neither German nor
another European colonial language. These are
everyday realities that don’t remain in the past but
still occur in the present. My parents still warn me
against speaking Tamil in public. They’re scared
that we'll encounter violence, as was the case in the
past. Do you believe that anyone is really scared to
speak English on the street? Scared that they might
be physically attacked? Against this background,
the rapid acceptance of English and English speak-
ers reveals very clearly a racist and classist societal
structure in the German public sphere.

Back to SAVVY: They've since (2022) imple-
mented parts of my critique. Their posts these days
are sometimes bilingual, now they even offer multi-
lingual tours! It does work! Do you reckon they
credited me for this? Did they make it transparent

116

how it came to this curatorial and linguistic-political
change?

M: Probably not.

S: Yeah! Free consulting from me, then (laughs)!

M: As this point, we should reiterate that we see
the problem primarily in the fact that English is
used as a shortcut to inclusivity, that it’s just an
illusion of inclusivity. With this, we don’t want to
say that everything should take place in German
because we happen to be in Germany. That isn't
the argumentation we're pursuing. Rather, we
want to draw attention to a flaw in reasoning, to
a lazy way of approaching inclusivity and margin-
alisation. Those who use English don't actually
have to concern themselves with local hierarchies.
For us, it’s not about giving the right to partici-
pate in the cultural sector solely to those who
grew up in Germany either. But we want to make
it apparent that, willingly or not, one is in direct
competition with others. Because the English-
speaking expat position often puts everything
else in the shade. In relation to this, I experience
on a regular basis that I am marked as an English-
speaking person as soon as I enter a cultural in-
stitution. The same happens in hip spaces, as we

117

described them at the beginning. Our bodies

are marked as being cosmopolitan as soon as they
present a certain style of dress, a certain self-as-
suredness, a certain aesthetic that’s read as being
cultivated. Because Germans are used to think-
ing that their fellow, non-white citizens must be
poor, and therefore won't be found in spaces like
museums, galleries and theatres in the first place.
As soon as the categories of ‘not white’ and ‘in
the culture sector’ overlap, in their eyes you must
be an expat.

S: I think here we have to make a more precise dis-
tinction. For example, in my case, people speak

to me in English in everyday spaces. And that’s obvi-
ously due to my skin colour, to the fact that my body
is apparently incompatible with this country, its
history and language. This “impossibility” of the
body seems to be so stark for some that, even in the
most banal situations, like in the bike shop or the
supermarket, I’m addressed in English even when
Ireply in German. I have this experience in common
with many Black and Tamil people, who are melanin-
rich and thus, for many pale people, appear all the
more foreign in this melanin-dead land. I believe
there’s little awareness of this, even among the racial-
ised populations with light skin, which still make up
the majority. Because we experience racism from

all pale populations, and that can also mean pale so-
called foreigners.

Our realities do intersect in certain situations,
but they also differ from each other significantly.
Melanin-rich people experience other forms of
dehumanisation, which happen more persistently,
go deeper and irrespectively of climate or location.
For white Europeans, our bodies appear less

118

human than those of the various melanin-dead groups
of non-European origin, which are more negotiable
and therefore able to progress quicker into repre-
sentative positions than we are. The way in which
we are mentally catapulted and held back from these
spheres is, again, different. I would say it’s more ex-
treme. We can’t be imagined in this context, which is
why we're faced as an impossibility in this country,
this landscape and this language. In my case, there’s
no ‘broken German with which to address me, I am
immediately addressed in another language. And
that’s already a distinction that is not afforded
enough attention. With me, there is always a switch
to English, because it’s unthinkable that someone
with this skin colour could speak German. The
emphasis here is on skiz colour, and not on other
racist biological characteristics.

Germans, by the way, often see this switch of lan-
guage as a gesture of good will. It happens time
and again that liberal, academicized Germans think
they’re doing me a favour by speaking to me in
English, and each time I have to think, ‘Hey, your
Denglish is really shitty. You can just speak to me in
German, then you'd be doing us both a favour.’ Even
in Wedding, you can't avoid these situations. Not
even in one of the poorest districts in the whole of
Germany. I find that really bizarre.

M: In this context, let’s talk about the Instagram
meme page that we looked at beforehand. From
this you can understand the difference between
expats and immigrants quite well. The page is
called berlinauslandermemes. Through memes, it
gives a very self-deprecating take on problems
with the immigration office (Auslanderbebérde):
for example, when you're not registered in your

119

apartment in Berlin or can’t speak German at your
appointment with a German official—a predica-
ment that’s not at all comparable to the situation
of those who go through the same system, but who
are threatened with deportation to a war zone.

For me and my friends, who also grew up as ref-
ugee children in Germany, there’s a lot of trauma
connected to the immigration office. I remember
having to go to there regularly as a four- or five-
year-old, in order to extend our suspension of
deportation or our residency permit, which was
always only valid for a short time. We waited
there a whole day in these packed rooms, with
crying babies and hardly any space to sit, only to
be shuffled around and treated unsympatheti-
cally by disrespectful and overworked officials.
lassociate the immigration office with fear and
humiliation. To this day, I believe I’m going to
be deported or deprived of my rights when I enter
these spaces, even when I’m just translating for
someone else.

So, when I look at the memes on berlinaus-
landermemes, I do get, as it’s so nicely put, trig-
gered. It seems not to matter to the makers that
the term Auslander’ is not just a legal designation
but also an insult. Ausidnder’is an exclusionary
category that’s not only about lacking a German
passport but also the degree of racialisation and
marginalisation you experience. The page claims
to curate Berlin-related inside jokes for so-called
Auslander*innen’ (foreigners of all gender expres-
sions), but their memes reveal much more about
which classes of people they themselves belong
to and how little they actually have to do with the
lived realities of people who have traditionally
been castigated as ‘Scheifsauslander’ (fucking for-
eigners). Although both the makers are white

120

expats from South Africa and Austria, they take
ona term and a role that cannot easily be discon-
nected from those who have to be Ausldnder’.
Being a foreigner is not an inconvenience, an
annoying anecdote, but for many people it’s a vio-
lent, even potentially deadly expulsion from this
society.

S: Yes, I also wanted to talk about this exact staging
of a supposed precariat of foreigners. By now, the
page has over 200,000 followers, so it’s really popu-
lar. I was also blocked by them for over a year, by
the way, after I criticised them for this online multi-
ple times. Their main clientele are expats in Berlin,
of whom I know many, as well as people who are
involved with expats and hence move in similar
milieus, and therefore understand the codes and
inside jokes. The memes are being shared constantly
by these people. A lot of people in my circle do it too.

M: [also know a lot of people who share
the page’s content.

S: So, we're like “native insiders”, though not natives,
just insiders (laughs). On these memes that stage
the threat to one’s residency status: I’ve been observ-
ing this for a few years now, how expats—whether
white or not—keep churning out their stories from
the immigration office on Instagram, with which
they want to generate empathy and often even ask

121

for support in a way that explicitly centres their des-
peration. As though they were really being threat-
ened with deportation to an impossible living situa-
tion and not to some suburb of Portland or Sydney.
And in the end-what a surprise! —in 100% of cases,
they get a three-year visa or a residence permit for
five years, straight away. The happy ending to this
drama is always pre-programmed and yet people still
wallow in self-pity, implying a kind of emergency
that is not that at all.

M: Yes! The threat that the immigration office
poses to refugees is in another category entirely
to the inconvenient bureaucracy that it presents
to expats.

S: Of course, every visa regime is based on the exclus-
ion of other people. That means that the mobility

of these people goes hand in hand with the immo-
bility, the exclusion and the marginalisation of the
majority of other people. I think this absolutely
must be said. Those who are churning out their im-
migration office dramas on Instagram and then
getting us involved as they stage some kind of emer-
gency or state of exception don’t consider this at

all. And nor do they consider what the immigration
office means for us. The fear that you're talking
about, when you enter the immigration office, I can
understand this so well. How many of us were actu-
ally stuck in immigration offices, really threatened
with deportation, and what’s more, deportation into
war zones or lives of poverty, and so on. I find this
truly appalling. Someone should point out to these
people that the immigration office is not a game.

122

I believe that the appointment at the immigration
office is the only moment in which all the non-Ger-
man-speaking expats from Western countries require
a translator. There are no bi- or trilingual forms
because the immigration office is not primarily pro-
cessing their cases but rather those of our families.
The state doesn’t want to put in any resources for
this, of course, which would be necessary in order to
offer another language. But I can well imagine that-
as long as the number of expats and with that, the
prominence of their lobby increases— we're going to
see English being included, though not Turkish,
Kurdish, Arabic or the language of another demo-
graphic of people who are deported in large numbers
and who have a lot to do with the immigration office.
These circumstances are often trivialised, but it’s
based on a really awful system linked with colonial-
ism; with classist, exploitative, capitalist structures,
which still oppress billions of people.

Against this backdrop, I find it especially terrible
when racialised expats from the West pander to
or even reproduce this way of speaking, acting and
thinking. Most expats I have anything to do with
are in fact racialised people, and I can also observe
this behaviour from them. I find this terrible, be-
cause I know that they’re very sensitive and percep-
tible when it concerns their own context. Then there's
akind of sensibility with which they worry about
the Bronx or Central Los Angeles being gentrified,
that something has happened in Barcelona or East
London. But they fail to see themselves here in the
same frame of action, the same mechanism of action,
in the same patterns that they deplore in the cities
they came from. Almost as if what happens here
were less real than what’s happening in Queens or
Cabbagetown.

123

M: What happens here is that a cosmopolitan,
mobile class catapults itself into local contexts,
as its mobility is already assured by the prevailing
global migration and border system. They then
enter into local contexts that function for them

who are expelled and repressed in applications for
state-subsidised cultural programmes by their
language and content. If we were to curate and
organise more pointedly on the basis of an analy-
sis of class and locality, totally different pro-

like stage sets, with which they don’t need to
get involved. The ignorance of the mobile classes
has so much to do with these conditions. It is
a privilege—and that’s something we have to
acknowledge-when local, structural problems
don’t concern you at all.

I'll never forget this one moment in Berlin, when
a wealthy person from Lebanon looked someone
over from afar who was coming towards us and
said: ‘She’s not FoB, is she?’-as in, having arrived
in Germany fresh off a refugee ship. On what
basis had he permitted himself this categorisation;
what was his analysis based on? He judges her
habitus, how she’s dressed, the self-confidence
with which she moves through Berlin. That was
one of the moments in which it became clear to
me that this description ‘of Color’ fails to include
many things entirely. With such terms, we fall
into a superficial representation culture, for
which we also end up fighting, but which makes
us replaceable for the aforementioned cultural
institutions and the City of Berlin. The praxis
of institutions that makes use of this vocabulary
creates a totally other reality to that which it
promises. Since, instead of actually bringing their

grammes and spaces would emerge than with
abstract concepts and anglophone identity con-
structions, with which most people outside of
our bubbles are not even familiar, let alone ever
consciously identify. Sometimes I walk down
Sonnenallee and wonder how many people here
identify as foreigners, rather than ‘of Color’.
What does this judgment mean for our political
or curatorial practice?

S: I think what you've addressed here is really impor-
tant. Berlin is like Disneyland for many adults of
capital-rich and/or Western expat circumstances.
Since 2015, the city has often been declared the exile
capital of the Arab world in different media, from
CNN to Al Jazeera. And even here, class relations are
not considered. Who comes to Berlin? Whose cul-
tures are valued here? Whose cultural production is
put to use here, and in which ways?

For example, that there is one Arabic film festival,
or since relatively recently, Arabic poetry nights ;
with Syrian or other Levantine literatures, shows
that here only certain cultures are acknowledged
and supported by German institutions. These things

own populations from the precarious margins
into the centre, or to the place where capital,
representation and access are, they’d rather im-
port people who already have capital to hand.
We can't grasp this problem properly without
bringing in class. I believe it’s central to this dis-
cussion. Here, I’m thinking about those people

124

didn’t exist in the same measure when Palestinian
refugees twice over fled the war in Lebanon in large
numbers to come to Berlin in the 70s and 80s. They
weren't worth it because the majority were not

part of'a bourgeois or academic class. Here, you see
that distinctions between various non-European
cultures and classes are being made. A distinction is

125

made between those who are recognised as “cultural
types” and promoted accordingly, but who actually
try to adorn themselves with this label, and those
who are neither regarded as culturally valuable nor
understood as being necessarily worthy of promo-
tion. This happens on the basis of both cultural and
racial markers. For example, you'll find little to
nothing in terms of Tigrinya literature and film fund-
ing in Berlin, although Tigrinya-speaking people
from Eritrea make up one of the largest groups of
asylum seekers in the last decade. The same applies
for Somali-speaking people. These are hierarchical
relations that are racist, classist and colonial. In the
end, this is about cultural production that, here or
elsewhere, is mostly created and sustained by elites.
I'm always fascinated by the fact that people—
from rich districts of Cairo, for instance—come here
and live out their creative and perhaps queer lives,
declare themselves People of Color and peddle this
identity, getting riled up with all kinds of Germans
with a Nazi background, without distinguishing
between the rich and those who come from poor
backgrounds and live somewhere on the outskirts of
Berlin or in poor housing within the city. Something
gets lost here! It’s a really distorted and decontex-
tualised way of going about things. It’s based on
a way of thinking that has a lot to do with the lan-
guage we use. On this point, we have to keep making
it clear that this language you mentioned earlier—
the People-of-Color language— produces a simplifi-
cation, a reduction, which homogenises us and makes
us into one mass, with no regard for our relation to
capital, our status, our histories, interests or even
our pain. That also means that we inevitably end up
competing with people who come from completely
other milieus, with whom we can never keep up.
These people have lived here for perhaps two years,

126

but they’ve already overtaken us by two or more gen-
erations. They may be part of the dominant classes
and castes elsewhere, even in the places where our
families’ stories began. Even if none of us here is
German, there was still never any possibility for us
to keep up with this group of people without a Nazi
background. Since, in the struggle for resources,
the people who were socialised here are disadvan-
taged from the outset: to be socialised here and

a person without a Nazi background often, though
perhaps not always, means that you grew up poor
and working class. Accordingly, the starting con-
ditions are usually not in our favour. This applies to
the education system as well as to the labour market
and, of course, to the housing market too.

This leads me to another really astonishing phe-
nomenon. When I’m on Instagram, I see that apart-
ment and spare room announcements in Berlin
are now posted almost exclusively in English. There
isn’t even a German translation! There, I ask myself:
What is this? Whom are you speaking to? Whom
do you want to live with? Who’s the main tenant here,
and who isn’t? I find this really terrifying, but at
the same time, from an analytical perspective, quite
fascinating. I think to myself: how does it come to
this, that suddenly even the people who move here
from other cities or rural regions of Germany feel
emboldened to broadcast their search for an apart-
ment entirely in English, hoping—and it’s not that
unlikely—to find an apartment in this city by doing
so? It’s just such a unique dynamic; these are market
relations that are very new, and they lead us back
to questions about language and capital. I see this in
my own networks especially, and each time I’m once
again both confused and fascinated.

127

M: Yeah, that’s why we're addressing this subject, M: Or because it’s improper to talk about money.

The historic division of Berlin and the separation
of Berlin from the surrounding country created
specific material and psychological realities with
which we're still living today. Because the capital of
the Federal Republic of Germany, which it only
became once again in the 1990s, still has to establish
itself. as such. The capital city of one of the richest
countries in the West still has to engage in a kind
of game whereby it must prove that it’s at all worthy
of being the capital city of one of the richest coun-
tries in the West. But this isn’t unusual. Historic
capitals, especially colonial metropolises like Paris
and London that didn’t experience such a histori-
eal and violent break, don’t have to go through this.
They just exist, as though they were museums.
Berlin is no museum but a construction site. It still
has to invent itself. And in this process of invention,
Berlin also wants to acquire capital, of course. To
do so, it must establish itself as a centre in Germany,
Europe and even beyond. This centralisation pro-
cess began in the 1990s as Berlin became the Federal
Republic of Germany’s capital city and seat of gov-
ernment, and continues with the consolidation
of the start-up industry and the infrastructures of
global players like Amazon, Zalando and Google, etc.
The forced internationalisation is equally part
of this. And the visa regime, which welcomes free-
lancers from the creative industry. Berlin facilitates
residency for artists and media creators witha
specifically regional interpretation of the laws of
residency, as it proceeds from an ‘overriding eco-
nomic interest in Berlin as a capital of art and film.
With this, the visa regulations that enable many
expats from abroad to stay in Berlin are tailored to
people from so-called developed countries (for
example, the USA, Japan, Israel, Canada, Australia,
and so on). They can arrive without visas, and

130

then they go through a simplified process thanks to
their freelance status in the art and media sectors.

So, in order to acquire capital, Berlin has come up
with a timely strategy: build up cultural produc-
tion, bring artists and freelancers over who keep the
mythology of the city alive and make it attractive
to the start-up industry and platform capitalism,
for which infrastructural measures are then financed
in turn.

Berlin wants to push, realise and bring this image
into line with the material reality, accordingly.
With that, we shouldn't forget that all that is part of
a huge PR machinery, it’s a propaganda machinery
about which we've already spoken. Just as the so-
called German Summer’s Tale of the 2006 football
World Cup was a branding strategy that was drawn
up and for which a PR agency was paid, here there’s
also a branding strategy put in place by the German
state and the city, in order to make Berlin into what
it ought to be in their eyes. And that isn’t the Berlin
that is kind to people like us, or those who grew
up in impoverished conditions here, but rather it’s a
Berlin that promotes, takes in and welcomes people
with capital. These are the people who have jobs
that we will probably never get. Because, in the end,
we look the way we look, our social economies are
as they are, and our bank accounts have the balance
that capitalists want for people like us.

M: In the end it’s about people—with or without a

Nazi background-—who are so socially precarious
that they may never be able to move beyond
their own city districts, who are pushed out of
their local contexts through gentrification and
excluded from this city. It’s this injustice for

which we'd like to find a critical language through

131

this discussion. All the globalised terms used to
speak about marginalisation and racism are
meaningless if we don’t speak about mobility,
locality and class at the same time, as well as the
ways they work together. Only on this basis

can we demand the social responsibility of public
institutions, that they involve the local popula-
tions in their programmes and spaces, instead of
talking past the majority of people.

1: The term ‘people with a Nazi background’ or ‘Menschen
mit Nazihintergrund is a play on the ubiquitous phrase
‘Menschen mit Migrationshintergrund in German, or
‘people with a migration background’. The latter is used
in everyday parlance to refer to many, diverse demo-
graphic groups, from Germans who are not white to
people whose recent immigration to Germany becomes
their defining feature (though not so-called expats).

To refer to ‘people with a Nazi background’ is to invent
an ironic counterpart to this artificial category, which
includes the majority of white Germans, all of whom
have, directly or indirectly, benefited from the legacies
of Nazism in Germany.
